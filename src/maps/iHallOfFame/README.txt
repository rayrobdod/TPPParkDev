Hall of Fame

# Description
The Hall of Fame is a building of white marble and fancy interiors (perhaps look at N's Castle?). In the center of the room is a statue or spinning globe or something that catches the eye. There are four exits. South leads back outside. The door to the north leads to the Season 1 Hall of Fame. The stairs to the west lead upward to the Season 2 Hall of Fame (with many empty locations). The stairs to the east lead downward to an undetermined Hall of Fame, which may include intermission games, or Season 3.

There is a door to the east also that leads to a bathroom, a hidden/joke location. The bathroom and the hallway that leads to it are hidden behind a black barrier wall. When the player walks in there, the hallway is a walking warp to the bathroom, during which the camera passes over a barrier wall that prevents the player from seeing the hallway. Another barrier prevents the player from seeing the main hall while in the bathroom.

The halls themselves have the camera positioned low and close to the player, so the player can see all the way down the hallway to the end. When examining one of the images upon the wall that depect a Hall Of Fame team (someone on the sub made a bunch), the camera will change angle temporarily to look at it, which a text box showing the name of the team. The Infodex entry for that team will be put into the Infodex, and the trainer and pokemon on the team will be marked as "seen" (now "owned").
