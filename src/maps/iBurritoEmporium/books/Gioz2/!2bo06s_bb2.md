So much has passed...and in so little time. In a single day, Cly beat both Drayden and Marlon, and not only that, but she has also managed to beat most of team plasma AND input a password with the help of the voices, I am certainly thankful with those voices, they have helped her a lot.

Cly decided the best course to take is to split into three groups in order to find Ghetsis: Wilbur and Dapper, Aipom, Zenny and Cly...and Quaffle and me, *glup* .

Zoro and Quaffle both walk alone in the plasma frigate. Neither of them has said a word, and both are blushing and looking other way.

"U-um...n-nice weather we have today...right?" said Quaffle nervous

"Quaffle...it's frozen thanks to Team Plasma, this weather is not nice..."

"U-um...right...uh..." Quaffle replied nervous. "I-I....Iwanttotalksomethingseriouswithyou."

"Uh..." Zoroark had a hard time understanding that, "Ok...I guess?"

"Yes! I mean...ahem...yeah, cool. I just wanted to tell you that I....I....I L-"

Quaffle was interrupted by Zoroark's voice. "INTERNET EXPLORER GUY!"

Zoroark ran into the center of the room where Colress was. "Oh, I wasn't expecting YOU here. Where's the host?"

"Like I'd tell you that!" replied Zoroark, his eyes burning with anger. "FREE THE ZORUA!"

"Oh, but I was having so much fun..." Colress replied, "Why don't we play for a while?"

"I'LL RIP YOU APART!" Zoroark charged at Colress.

"Tsk, tsk. When will you learn, 'Zoro'?" Said Colress while throwing a SnagBall at him.

Zoroark easily evaded. "YOU CAN'T GET ME WITH SUCH A CHEAP TRICK!"

"I wasn't aiming at you." Colress replied with an evil smile.

Zoroark quickly turned around and saw how Quaffle, not being fast enough, couldn't move away from the Snagball in time, and gets contained in it. The ball starts shaking.

"QUAFFLE! GET OUT, NOW!" Zoroark yelled in tears, remembering how he almost lost her once that way.

"I wouldn't count on it." Said Colress, laughing at Zoroark. 

The ball stops shaking. Zoroark couldn't believe it, how was it possible? Quaffle was with full energy...until he noticed...the ball was purple.

"Last time I failed because I transformed a Pokeball into a Snagball, however, this time I decided to step up, and use a masterball."

Zoroark fell into his knees, crying. He...he just lost another friend...and just like that time, in the forest, he couldn't save his friend.

Colress picked up the Masterball. "Don't worry, you still will see her again, right now."

He threw the masterball into the air and Quaffle got out of it, with red eyes, and a blank expression.

"Q-Quaffle?!" said Zoroark, getting close, "It's me...Zoro, you remember me, right? Everything's ok, right?"

"Unfeazant, please show him your love with an Fly." Colress ordered.

Quaffle without saying anything flapped her wings. Zoroark couldn't believe it...it was, impossible to describe...his own friend...the only one that really cared for him...she didn't remember him...he just stood there, with tears on his eyes, as Quaffle landed a crital hit on him using Fly.

Colress laughed at Zoro while he just laid in the floor, not sure of what to do anymore.

...

"Well, that's the last one." said Dapper Gator to Wilbur, who just beat up the last Plasma Grunt in the area.

"...Yes, let us return to Cly at once." 

"I couldn't agree more, kind sir." replied Dapper while he was walking behind him, suddenly, a big earthquake happens.

"W-what's that?!" Said Wilbur

"I have no idea...let us go and check on Cly, now!"

They ran towards the direction Cly took.

"I feel...a presence." Wilbur stated. "It's....It's a legendary Pokemon!"

"I feel it too, good sir. But I think you're wrong, I sense two legendary Pokemon!"

They arrived to Cly, who was standing before Ghetsis, who was laughing maniacally, and behind him, the legendary Pokemon Kyurem

"ICE GUNS I'M PACKING!" stated Ghetsis, not making any sense to Cly.

"Old man...calm down and take a deep breath." Cly stated in response, "This can be solved by talking like normal people."

'DIE!" Ghetsis yelled as Kyurem, using his powers, froze Cly.

"THIS IS IT!....FINALLY! IT'S THE END OF THE VOICES! HAHAHAHA! I CAN CONQUER UNOVA, FINALLY!"

"I wouldn't be so sure, father." A guy stepped in, it was N, and behind him, Zekrom.

Zekrom used his powers to thaw Cly and her 'mon out of the ice.

"This ends here, and now." N stated, but Ghetsis just laughed.

"YOU'RE JUST IN TIME, KID WITHOUT A HUMAN HEART!" Ghetsis said as he commanded Kyurem to fuse with Zekrom, making it become...Black Kyurem.

"THIS IS NOT ALL!" Ghetsis yelled as he pressed a button. Then...hundreds of machines began moving in the distance, coming towards them.

"W-what are those things?!"  exclaimed Cly, scared.

"Drive..." stated N, "I take your experiment went well then, father."

"YES! AND NOT ONLY THAT! I MASS PRODUCED THEM! I HAVE HUNDREDS OF 'LORD DRIVES' IN THIS PLACE, ALL WITH TWO OBJECTIVES: KILL YOU AND TAKE UNOVA!"

"Zoro...Quaffle...where are you?" Cly wondered to herself, looking down...but then she looked up, with a determined look, taking Zenny's Pokeball in her hand. "I can handle all of them by myself."

"I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT, LITTLE GIRL!" Ghetsis said as he snapped his fingers, a guy appeared from the shadows behind him. "ZACH, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO."

The man smiled as he pressed a button on a strange device he had.

A portal appeared over Cly...and she just fell to the ground, holding her head with both heads in pain.

"Cly!" yelled Wilbur, Dapper and N. N then said, "What are you doing to her, father?!"

"I AM TAKING ALL THE VOICES AWAY FROM HER...YOU ALL SHOULD BE THANKFUL, IF YOU WERE NOT GOING TO DIE RIGHT NOW!"

Thousands of Lord Drives got close and started charging their beams. Meanwhile Zoro was unable to fight back as Colress ordered Quaffle to attack him without mercy.

"Is this....is this how it ends...?" Zoroark wondered to himself as he was unable to move from the pain.
