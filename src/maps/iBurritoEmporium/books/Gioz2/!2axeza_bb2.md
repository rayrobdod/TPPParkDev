Zoroark was launched into the floor by a devastating attack made by Clay's Nidoking, Nidoking chuckled while Zoroark was laying on the floor

"Weak." said Nidoking to Zoroark, while he lost consciousness.

...

Zoroark woke up in a grassy patch, it was very conformable, he noticed something: he was smaller! He somehow because a Zorua...but how? He looked to his right, and there was a young boy, laying next to him, looking at the sky.

"I wonder where my daddy and my mommy are, Zorua" said the young boy, "We have been searching for them for so many moons already. Why did they leave me? Don't they love me?"

Zorua smiled at the boy, and snuggled with him

"It doesn't matter so much." Said the boy, "I have you and my other friends, those are the family I need"

Suddenly, a man came from the distance

"Here you are! My child!" said the man, "I've been looking all over for you." 

Zorua's vision became blurry after that.

...

He opened his eyes and looked around, he was at a Pokemon Center, he looked at his body, he was a Zoroark. "That was obviously a dream" he said to himself, "There's no way I'd go back into a puny Zorua." 

Zoroark then looked at his right, there was Quaffle on a chair next to him, looking at a window. Then she turned around.

"Zoroark!" She said happily, "I'm so glad to see you're fine!"

Zoroark blushed, there she goes again, acting so weirdly with a stranger, why is she so nice with him?

"It wasn't a big a deal" said Zoroark, acting cool, "Did we win?"

Quaffle shook her head with a sad expression. "I'm afraid not...but...I don't mind, as long as you're ok." 

"Th-thanks" said Zoroark, getting up, "Where is Cly and the others?"

"Cly left because she is afraid of PCs." said Quaffle, almost laughing, "Aipom is going to 'get me a gift', Dapper is just walking outside the Pokemon Center, Zenny is doing another of his 'calls' and Wilbur...Well, I don't know where Wilbur is."

"Who is Wilbur?" asked Zoroark, it was the first time he heard that name.

"Oh, that's Emboar's name" replied Quaffle, "I doubt you'd hear that name from him, he's ashamed of it, only Zenny and I know it."

"Oh, I see." said Zoroark, looking at all the Audinos walking around, "What's the deal with that guy, anyway?"

"He...had a rough past." said Quaffle looking down, "Life as a fire starter isn't easy. His brother, Kevin, disappeared two years ago, leaving no trace, he is searching for him, he says that's the only reason he sticks with us. He is so worried for his brother that he doesn't even eat...I'm worried."

"He should be ok." Said Zoroark, "I'm pretty sure  he's out there, somewhere."

"You're right! But...there is something I'd like to talk to you about." Said Quaffle, blusing, "It is...uhh...I...I...I'll see you at the beach!" Quaffle panicked and flew away.

"What was that all about?" asked Zoroark to himself.

"My dear Zoro" said Zenny, who appeared out of nowhere, "It's obvious! She likes you, and a lot I'd say"

"Why are you calling me Zoro?" replied Zoroark, a bit angry, "And why would she like me?"

"You needed a nickname, so everyone will call you Zoro from now on," replied Zenny "And her actions just state it, if I were you, I'd get some flowers somewhere, and head to the beach right away. Now, I have more calls to make, I have *almost* made Elesa my client, I am *this* close, I tell you!"

Zenny left...and Zoroark was feeling confused as he left the Pokemon Center, his heart felt weird, why would *she* of all the Pokemon, like him? He decided to follow Zenny's advice and got some flowers and head to the sea right away. He got to the sea, but what he saw, that made him very angry.

Quaffle was sitting next to Aipom, looking at the sunset.

"I have something to tell you" said Aipom to her

"T-that's good" replied Quaffle, "B-but I'm really waiting for someone..."

Zoroark couldn't hear them, and he got *angry* tossing the flowers away, he left, Quaffle turned and called him to explain, but it was too late.

"How could I have listened to that fool?" said Zoroark to himself, "She didn't like me at all, I'm so stupid..."

Zoroark was about to cry, but then he found Cly.

"Zoro! There you are!" said Cly with a smile, "Do you want to go training? WE NEED TO MOLD CLAY!"

Zoroark couldn't get what she meant, but he nodded. For days, Zoroark kept training and training nonstop to be able to beat Clay. He didn't talk at all to the other 'mon those days, however...

Zoroark was in the floor, once more, defeated by Nidoking. It still isn't enough to beat Clay...why? What was holding him back? He quickly reached a conclusion: it was Cly. Cly and the other 'mons were what hold him back. He then decided he didn't need them. 

"Zoro, use Nasty Plot!" ordered Cly as they battled a trainer.

"No." Zoroark replied, "I'm done with you guys, I don't need you."

Zoroark then fled into the woods. "Zoro! Wait!" said Cly running after him.

"I don't need weaklings like you" said Zoroark to himself, "I can take back what they stole for me....I can take it back, and without your help."
