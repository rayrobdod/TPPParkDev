*You came to me whole, but breaking.*

*You found strength in others, you cared, you cherished the time you had with them, with me.*

*You fought long and hard, all the while you break, all the while you continue to suffer.*

*You are fragile, yet you tried to protect us all.*

*It was my turn to do the same.*

*I leave with you my power, my stability, a connection to the Root of all life.*

*The power of earth is in your hearts, your minds, your very souls.*

*And in my final day, with my final words... The last of a once immortal being, I give all that I am, all that I* **was** *to you.*

*Goodbye, sweet child, even in death, I will be with you, always.*

Tears dropped onto the letter as Aoi trembled, Trumpinch and Treesus standing behind her, watching in depressed silence. "Are you going to be okay?" Her Trapinch asked concern on her face. "Aoi?"

The trainer didn't reply with words, simply dropping to her knees, and crying even louder, the letter held at her side.
