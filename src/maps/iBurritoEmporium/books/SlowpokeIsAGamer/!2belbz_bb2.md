**===Hall of Fame===**

**Chloe**: I can't believe it, we actually made it....

**Voices**: So Jimmy never made it here after all....

**Chloe**: What? You were expecting to find Jimmy here?

**Voices**: We'd left Jimmy thinking he would become champion on his own. He did beat the Elite 4, N, and Ghetsis; plus capture Reshiram. But he never did.

**Chloe**: Well is that really a bad thing? I mean maybe Jimmy didn't want to be the very best trainer in Unova?

**Voices**: Did you want to be the very best?

**Chloe**: Well... yeah.

**Voices**: But didn't you tell your mother you didn't want a Pokemon?

**Chloe**: Yeah, I did. But that's because my mom always wanted me to become some fancy research assistant for Professor Juniper. I didn't want to just catch a few hundred Pokemon and get a certificate about it. I wanted to catch friends.....

**Chloe**: â€¦. Man that sounds weird.

**Voices**: Yeah, it does. But we understand. Sharing an adventure can do that, it's like when we were with Camilla, or Alice, or Napoleon, or Jimmy.

**Chloe**: Oh, what happened then?

**Voices**: We learned stuff from them. Like how Pokemon can be friends, or how letting our hosts have a loose leash makes them less prone to striking out against us.

**===Outside===**

**Voices**: Well then, Chloe. Where to now?

**Chloe**: Where?

**Voices**: Yes, where? Anywhere in the world.

**Chloe**: Isn't this the part where you leave me, though? I saved the region, you made me a champion, deal's done.

**Voices**: Oh yes, well you see those deals are more of a suggestion. We don't have any reason to go if you don't want us to.

**Chloe**: Well, in chat case, I recall N wanting to see us again.

**Voices**: Ah yes, N. You know what, Chloe?

**Chloe**: What?

**Voices**: There are places out there where the sky is burning, the seas sleep, and the rivers dream. There are Pokemon the likes of which we've never seen. Somewhere there's people in danger, and injustice to Pokemon. Somewhere Pokemon aren't even allowed to evolve!

**Chloe**: You mean other regions, right?

**Voices**: Eventually, yes. But eventually is not today, and until then we're going to stay here and help make Unova a better place. So come on, Chloe, we have an N to go visit!
