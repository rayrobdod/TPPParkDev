The home was dark. Curtains drawn, windows latched shut. It looked like a cave inside...

**Bill**: So, you came then?

**Voices**: There he is, it's Bill! All alone!

**Bill**: I don't have anything left to give you. And you have nothing left you can take from me.

**Voices**: There he is, Aooo. Kill him, kill him and eat his meat.

**Aoooo**: .... You're the dreaded Bill?

**Bill**: Dreaded?  Hardly. I don't think I've been that in years. After my own daughter exposed my PC? I'm just a collector on the run now. Alice runs the PC now.

**Aoooo**: Hard to believe you're what the Voices were so terrified of. They even want me to kill you.

**Bill**: Not surprising. Would it amaze you to know all of this began over a Torchic?

**Aoooo**: And what happened to this Torchic?

**Bill**: The Voices had their host release it. And in a fury to find out who was in charge of the PC? They released others.

**Voices**: Lies, he killed Zexy! He sent his agents to try and release more Pokemon, too!

**Bill**: Am I lying? You may never know for sure. But yes, I did send Pokemon to watch the Voices. They threatened to dismantle my collection of borrowed Pokemon, and I had to stop it. I'm a collector, not a killer. What good is a dead bird compared to one that's alive?

**Aoooo**: Not much. But what are you just sitting here for? It's been years like you said, you could be relaxing in some fancy place like Kalos by now.

**Bill**: The Voices would follow me there, too. They're relentless. At least here I get to wait for my end in my old hometown.

**Aoooo**: Your end?

**Bill**: The Voices want me dead. Blood for blood. That's why they're still around.

**Aoooo**: No, they said--

**Voices**: Stop talking already, Kill Bill!

**Aoooo**: Shut up! They said they were going to help calm the Pokemon, fix this Randomizing. And if they don't want to, I'll make them!

**Bill**: Heh heh, strong words, young girl. Can you really tame the Voices, though?

**Aoooo**: ... Voices, I won't kill him. But if it's true he's a wanted man now, I'll turn him in instead.

**Bill**: You will?

**Aoooo**: We will.

**Bill**: Very well, then. Maybe you can indeed tame the Voices bloodlust. If it's true you want to fix Johto and Kanto, that sorry party won't do you any good. I have one last Pokemon left, it's my personal Gloom. He's been with me since I was a kid. I got him as just an Oddish, but I won't need him now. I'll be here, waiting...
