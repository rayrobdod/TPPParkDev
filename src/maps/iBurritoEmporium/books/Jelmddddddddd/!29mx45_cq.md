Conquest was like a back story set centuries in the past of the first host, lady ABnp3a, when the voices were possibly at their weakest with only around 400 of them. They originally used the system of democracy to conquer ransei but were ultimately stopped by arceus who took advantage of the voices inability to beat rhythmic mini games to prevent them from defeating it, but ABnp3a used the almighty power of the streamer to tame the god and take control of it, with the voices numbers rising each time they used the power to control arceus. This gave the voices ultimate power, and after that the voices began to have a love for ancient gods, ABnp3a had control over arceus and so they wanted to give the all powerful god an order that it would not be able to resist, but the voices became split between two ideas,one half of the voices wanted to maintain order and democracy . But the other half wanted anarchy and freedom, so arceus took the powers of anarchy and democracy and split them into two fossils, helix and dome, but also made a third one, amber of balance. Arceus then became free from ABnp3a's control as the voices lost their power, so arceus banished them for thousands of years for controlling it, but gave them a small shred of the power of anarchy so that when they reawakened they could control a host to choose a fossil, so that fossil's power would become their primary way of controlling their host, but for the other one to be just a power that they could use momentarily if it was allowed by arceus in a manor of judging varying between if more of them wanted it, or a timer that would give it to them every hour. So the voices then left ABnp3a and weren't heard from again until one day they found a boy named red and made him hail helix.
