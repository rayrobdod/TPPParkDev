Chloe flipped through the book she was given but it was just retelling of AJ's journey in Johto through, why would he want his successors to have it? But then she made it to the epilogue,

"I want to start off my conclusion with statement: I never wanted to bring war. It was an unforeseen consequence of my final battle with my predecessor Red. I wanted to end the reign, but it just threw the whole world out of balance and allowed a man named Bill, a man I thought was my friend, to take control and go fully mad. That was my only regret but it has haunted me ever since. I wanted to spread the word of love, that all 'Mon were equal but my message was skewed along the way. I never intended for this to be written but something came over me and so after one year I have written my journey and I hope this finds the other hosts that follow because I know there will be more.-AJ" The page read but there was more,

"My name is A, well Camila A. Slash but that doesn't fit me anymore. I didn't get what to do with this when my dad handed me it after I defeated him but much has happened to me during this journey to where I'm glad I can write it down. I have lost much, but I have gained more in friendship. I have found love, I hope he can get that I still love him through any pain I have caused him. To future Hosts reading this remember you can overcome anything if you hard enough and put in a long days to do it.-A" Yet there was more,

"I was the first host, this came to me late, find happiness in the chaos.-Red" and more,

"There is reason to every bad thing that happens. If you keep your head straight you can understand. My father may have caused many bad things but he, at his core, was still a kind, reasonable man. The others won't admit it but I stand by it. Same as I do with The Voices guiding me carefully to help through this chaotic world. I may not know what's real but trust me when I say that they give you an unforgettable experience.-Alice" 

"I didn't like the idea of Pokémon at first, but now I love them all, hell I helped bring an entire species to prominence again and gave a cute Legendary a toy instead of a battle. They're great to me and I'm great to them, if you have ever felt like you hated Pokémon and didn't want to go on a journey, just remember that they will be there for you no matter what.-Napoleon" 

"Oh My Helix This Was A Great Journey! I Even Met The Gods Themselves! I Found True Love With Sabrina, I'm So Glad The Voices Made Come Back To See Her! Despite Some Questionable Actions They Really Helped Me Grow As A Person And I Met New Friends In Both Pokémon And Humans! I Really Can't Repay Them!-Aurora(I like to called my wolf name Aoooo)"

"Wow, what a journey I have been on. I was a big fan of The Voices, they were the best Legends and even when I outgrew those I was always happy to learn about those myths that I now know are more than myths. If it wasn't for them I would still be just playing on my computer doing nothing but they gave me purpose. I found friendship with their help, I somehow became Champion with a team that I felt was just cute and cool. I also found brotherhood in an unexpected location. I am currently wandering to where my heart takes me. I have seen many parts of the world, but if I still haven't returned to my home region of Unova and I don't think I can. They see me as a Legend or a Hero when I really am not. I am just a kid who got lucky when the time actually mattered. I am not a hero or a legend, and neither are you, you're just another person who happened to be chosen, nothing more.-Jimmy"

Chloe closed the book with tears in her eyes about to fall,

"Thank you," she whispered to not only her Pokémon but also the Voices. All her Pokémon one by one started cuddling around her as she felt each Champion passing what they have learned to her. She took a deep breath and then gave a smile to her team.
