Hilda stepped inside the subway station and she could feel the glory that had alluded her so many times before, this was her time to show what she's worth. She walked over to the registration counter to be put into the tournament but received unpleasant news,

"Sorry, but we only have room left in the Doubles Tournament, you're more then welcome to join that," the registration officer informed,

"But I saved up all the money I could get to enter into the singles tournament," Hilda snarled, "I'm not sharing glory with anyone."

"I'm sorry there's nothing I can do," he looked into her desperate eyes, "OK, I'll give you a Doubles V.I.P pass it allows you access to all Pokémon we have stored here along ones you already have, but you didn't get it from me."

"OK, that's alright, who's my partner?" She asked,

"Um, huh, OK it appears the only other person in the Doubles Tournament without is someone named Jimmy C." The officer informed,

"Hopefully this will work out good," Hilda shrugged. When she turned around there was a kid her age behind her, "Hello?"

"Hi I'm your partner," Jimmy wheezed,

"Hmm, you seem odd," Hilda backed away,

"It's OK," Jimmy laughed, "I'm a nice guy, and I'm going to be the Champion."

"You, Champion?" Hilda sneered, "That's rich, but he your ambitious, I like that."

"I like you, well your booty," Jimmy blurted,

"What!?" Hilda slapped him,

"Sorry I'm not sure why I said that, it's not like I've been fantasizing about your butt," Jimmy apologized,

"Right," Hilda sighed, "Let's get to battling before I kill you."

"Cool, cool cool cool," Jimmy scratched his head, "Let's Roll Out."

"Stop, referencing those obscure Champions from those far off regions, that's so old." Hilda rolled her eyes,

"Just came naturally," Jimmy shrugged. They continued into the subway but met with some unforeseen challenges, namely Jimmy just looking at Hilda's butt while his Pokémon attack her Pokémon. They as assumed lost,

"WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT!?" Hilda screamed,

"Teamwork?" Jimmy shrugged,

"Teamwork you say? Teamwork!? That was you being a fool and ruining my chances to help my family, and you don't even care!" Hilda cried,

"I'm sorry," Jimmy muttered,

"Sorry!?" Hilda repeated, "Sorry is for bullshitters, you said you wanted to be the the Champion, why, why would an idiot like *you* want to be Champion?"

"For a video game," Jimmy sighed,

"Hah, a Video Game!?" Hilda laughed, "I want to be Champion to help my family get out of this place, and someone like *you* thinks of it as a joke, you actually have a Trainer Card right? Give it to me so I can battle the Gym Leaders and Elite 4."

"I can't," Jimmy whispered,

"Why not?" Hilda questioned,

"The Voices wouldn't let me," Jimmy confessed,

"Voices!? Who do you think you are the next coming of Red, AJ, A, Alice, Napoleon, Aurora? Don't me stupid, you're a schizophrenic idiot who probably shouldn't be around Pokémon, I've seen some shit in my short life, stuff you wouldn't believe."

"I've been through shit too," Jimmy mumbled,

"Like What?" Hilda asked,

"Just last week I released almost all my 'Mon, just yesterday I released two more and lost a friend," Jimmy confessed,

"That isn't called being through shit, that's called being a bad trainer and probably a bad friend," Hilda replied, "I've seen a man get electrocuted by a Zebstika, another guys eyes plucked out by Pidoves, just a couple days ago some guys who were importing illegal Pokémon got beat to death by a Hitmonchan, that's shit, now let me leave and don't be stalking me because I know people." She started walking away and Jimmy didn't follow. She made it back up to the surface but when she did a gang started ganging up on her.

"Yep that's her, she's the one who stole my Pokémon," Their leader explained, "Now since the police won't do anything let's put matters in our own hands."

"Please don't kill me," Hilda cried, "I'll give back your Pokémon, just don't kill me!"

"Kill you?" The Leader smiled, "Not yet, let's see what's under these little hooker shorts first." Suddenly the man got struck by a volt of lightning.

"Ah crap it's her," one of the thugs said,

"Let's get out of here!" Another cried,

"I ain't scared of you," The Leader stood up holding a Pokéball,

"You should be," the woman said, "Emolga Volt Switch." The man got hit by more lighting and collapsed. "You OK?" The woman asked,

"You're Elesa," Hilda awed, "The Gym Leader."

"Yup," Elesa admitted, "I saw you're Subway battle, can't believe that idiot partner of yours managed to beat me."

"He really beat you?" Hilda asked shocked,

"Yeah, he also kept talking about my Grandfather and hitting on me, weird kid," Elesa thought, "Come on back to my place, we can talk more there." As Elesa suggested the two went back to her place and talked, "So, your family is really struggling,"

"Yeah, I didn't think you would even care," Hilda gave a little grin,

"Why, because I'm a rich and famous model and Gym Leader," Elesa replied, "I try to help as many people as I can get out poverty or at least off the streets."

"No I wasn't saying that," Hilda apologized,

"Yeah you were, but it's okay a lot of people have a misconception of me, comes with the job," Elesa stated, "Anyway, I have a deal for you."

"A deal, what?" Hilda asked,

"I'll help your family get out of their struggles if you become my apprentice," Elesa told her,

"Of course, is that even a question?" Hilda asked,

"It's not going to be easy," Elesa informed,

"I don't care, anything's better then living in a two bedroom apartment with five sibling and your grandmother," Hilda explained, "Plus not working with people like that Jimmy guy."

"Oh yeah, that reminds me, I should call my friend Skyla and warn her about that kid," Elesa dialed her Xtranceiver to Skyla,

"Elesa, I haven't heard from you in a couple weeks, what up?" Skyla greeted,

"Nothing much, just wanted to tell you that a strange kid named Jimmy might be coming your way, he doesn't seem dangerous but you never know," Elesa informed,

"OK, I'll make sure to keep an eye out," Skyla agreed,

*One Week Later*  
Jimmy is bouncing around Skyla's Gym,

"Not sure what Elesa was thinking, this kid is kind of cute, just a little weird, and she knows how I like weird," Skyla smiled watching Jimmy shoot him self out of a cannon after cannon.
