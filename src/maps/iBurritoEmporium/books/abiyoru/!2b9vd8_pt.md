My mother once told me I come from greatness.

I could believe it, for she, herself, was great: a skilled agent, a powerful fighter, she overcame initial weakness to become one of the most formidable of the Court of the Sun.  People say she is ungainly, but I am proud to be in her image.

She didn’t raise me.  She was always busy with missions and investigations.  I was raised by my father and his mate.  Solareon, the True Prophet, the fiery warrior; I didn’t inherit any of his fire, despite my name, only his rock smash, next to useless in battle, but helpful in the field.  The beautiful Sparkles Sunshine was more like a mother to me, kind and gentle, but also fierce.  She taught me to love and protect what is important, and to value myself as I am rather than what I wish to be.  

Of course, I never deluded myself into thinking Father would choose my mother over her.  Their brief affair was a mistake, an accident, a giant misunderstanding.  He sought her advice, and she misjudged the kind of advice he wanted.  Despite his power, he was too naïve to understand the full reality of what had happened until he was confronted with Sparkles’ broken heart.  Eventually, he won her understanding and forgiveness, but he could not undo me.  And so, they, with his sense of duty and her loving generosity, took me in.  My mother did her best to teach and advise me, and for a while, I felt the most blessed being in the world, with three great parents, many friends, and a trainer stern but kind as the Sun’s warmth on a cold winter’s day.

Then two things happened.  The first, and most enlightening, was the birth of my half-brother, made possible, at last, by Sparkles’ evolution after the voices ceased to control our trainer.  I love Sunflare like a brother, and he feels likewise about me, but his existence made painfully obvious that I was not the intended product of this great love story, and the real thing is far more glorious than I will ever be.

The second thing was my coming of age, and with it, my learning of the origin of my name.  Flarebarel.  Once Flaredoof, before my evolution.  Flarebarel Nappaw.  No one would explain to me the latter part of my name until they deemed me old enough to handle it.  The day I evolved, my mother called me an adult and told me the story.  She spoke of a brave, hardworking bidoof who became the victim of a horrible accident.  The others still hesitate to speak of him for fear of opening old wounds, and our trainer stumbles over saying my full name.

My mother was his replacement.  She was added to the team out of necessity, because they needed someone who could use field moves.  For a long time, she was a mere slave for transportation, her attempts to become part of the team seemingly ruined by that unfortunate incident, just when someone was trying to reach out and include her.  And I am her son, carrying the name of her enshrined predecessor as a memorial.  I am regret and a painful memory embodied.

But my mother is no longer hated.  She worked hard to become strong and put her blood and sweat into winning the battles that had to be won.  She went from my father’s ill-starred advisor to one of his greatest battle-partners.  She became a bulwark of strength in the team, a story to look up to, and an inspiration for the others to train harder.  My father became one of the greatest warriors the fire-type has ever produced in defiance of all precedent, and my foster-mother is the ultimate example of love and forgiveness, for she loves me as though I were her own.  They all do, even as they love Sunflare, and if he is more praised for his beauty and power, he is no more valued than I.      

For I am Flarebarel Nappaw, and I come from greatness.   

**Ending Notes**

Flarebarel is, of course, from the egg produced by Solareon and 006 at the daycare and is now a bibarel.  Sunflare is the child of Solareon and Sparkles/Sunshine, and, as such, hatched as a shinx.  Someone bred them in the Platinum save file (after evolving Sparkles) and obtained a male shinx to whom they gave that nickname.  For the purposes of this story, I am assuming that Solareon and Sparkles could not breed because she was still in her basic stage, and once we left Napoleon and stopped preventing evolution, she evolved and became able to have a child.
