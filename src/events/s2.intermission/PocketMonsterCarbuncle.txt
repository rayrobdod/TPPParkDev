	As you progress through the game you recruit other Pok√©mon to your cause to a total of 20, four of each type (celerity, balance, strength, super power and defence, which roughly correspond to electricity/flying, water/grass, fighting/fire, psychic/normal, rock/ground types in the original games, with each type being strong against the next one).

Fighting against evil Torchics named "Yacamo" in-game, and "Zexy" by chat (of course). Also Shroomish can kick.
