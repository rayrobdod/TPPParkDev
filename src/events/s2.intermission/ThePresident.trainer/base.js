	In the game the protagonist's grandpa is the president of the Robopon company, 
	and he's retiring and setting you up as the new company president, and he gives 
	you his first robot (Sunny, in the picture) to start you off.
	
	But we kept using "a9" to speed through the dialogue, so chat heard something about 
	how we were the new president and we were all hyped but had no idea why and what we 
	were the new president of until we reset the game and had to read that dialogue a 
	couple more times. :p

The main character of RoboPon Sun, Cody. Though we gave him many other four-letter names,
the most famous being "Cunt", and "Anal".

The president apparently went to war, as the next intermission game was Battleship.
