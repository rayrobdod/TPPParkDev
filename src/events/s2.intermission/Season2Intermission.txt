So we started pickup our protagonist, the President of AAAA, Curt Alan. AAAA produce robots but they are involved into a some rough patches and so his parents left him with a almost bankrupt company and his grandpa who can't remember his name. To revive interest in the company we declare war to a neighbouring nation, this of course doesn't give us great ratings of approval and his name is quickly slandered into President Cu#t A#a!. Despite this we engage into a naval war long enough to steal the Improbability Badge under the guise of Xiaozhi (he got a hat), but he's kidnapped by Rocket Brigade so now Bobo, the electric Pidgey- ^^Psst ^^Bobo ^^is ^^ded ^^^No ^^^he ^^^isn't ^^^^maybe ^^^^he ^^^^zombie Piku has to gather other Magic Babies  and save the president while fighting hordes of undead Zexys... ^(Zexies?)
