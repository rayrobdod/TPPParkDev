New Trainer:

Rival: Blue
Player: AIIIAAB ("Abe", "Ahab", "Alibaba")

Starter: Charmander ("Growlmander", "Growlmeleon")
	Route 1:
		Growlmander due to the way he growls instead of fights. He's managed to kill a few grass types, and is therefore dubbed a vegetarian.

Route 1: 
	- Pikachus galore (call the Jailer or Gatekeepikachu because it kept knocking us out with parahax and thunder shock, even at lvl 3, and keeping us from leaving Pallet) 
		- Pika Blackouts: 5

Route 2/Viridian Forest:
	- We keep blacking out before getting anywhere in the viridian forest
	- Abe constantly checks his map, leading many to believe he is utterly lost. Especially since he's finding pokemon where they shouldn't be.
	- At 6 hours in, Abe had not yet entered a pokecenter to checkpoint (due to the Viridian Ledges).
		- "Abe prefers his pokemon be healed by his mother's loving care than by some cold machine at the hands of a Stepford Smiler nurse."

	CAUGHT: Kakuna! ("Kakuna Matata")
		- Mostly hated as it does fuck all except harden.
		- It's later celebrated when it does damage! (A wild pokemon Disabled its Harden move)
		- Boxed 20h 30m, returned 0d 21h 1m

Pewter City:
	- Brock's Gym is a bitch
		- The Lightyears kid has a Kabuto and Omnymite
			- "Buzz Lightyear" is defeated with an insane Wattson rating of 0.65 Wa, the most of any "normal" trainer to date.
			- Some call him a Young Wattson because of this.
			- http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/2vqhtu/anniversary_red_day_1_discussion_thread_chu_shall/cok5jo4
		- Brock has a lvl 15 Onix and lvl 17 Amber
			- Defeated on 0d 18h 29m with Growlmeleon, Kakuna, and Polywag
	- Charmelon evolution!

	CAUGHT: Polywag ("Polyswag")
		- It can take out Brock's Onix with one Bubble
		- Taught Take Down
	
Route 3:
	- Before leaving on Route 3, we manage to buy 6 balls and 1 potion with the money from Brock (Sensible!)
	- Then we fight a Lass with a Dratini, and proceed to throw all 6 balls at her pokemon, wasting them all... (FailFish)
	- He also keeps going to the Museum, paying for entry, and leaving once again.
		- http://www.reddit.com/r/twitchplayspokemon/comments/2vqhtu/anniversary_red_day_1_discussion_thread_chu_shall/cokfmuj
	- He boxed Kakuna, and then pulled him back out when everyone wanted him back

"Abe loves every pokémon equally! He sees the hidden potential in each one of them and will bring it out with the power of friendship!"

Looking at this team, I can't help it but think of Abe as this tiny, adorable child who doesn't care about becoming a champion and doesn't care about Helix or Dome; he just cares about traveling with pokémon and having fun on his adventure. He sees potential in every pokémon, no matter how weak they may be, and he'll bring it out with the power of FRIENDSHIP! (and lots of grinding but that totally counts as bonding.) He kept running back in tears to his mom every time his new pokémon fainted; he needs to check the map and get directions over and over, to the point where it looks like he may have trouble reading; he kept trying to buy that Magikarp without enough money as if he couldn't count it, or couldn't understand its value; this totally sounds like a small child to me!

Misty:
	- Took 17 tries
	- Beat with a burn via Flamethrower, and then Magikarp splashing it to death.
	- Charizard, Magikarp, Poliwag, Kakuna, Krabby, Onix
	- Three different pokemon got levels as a result of this fight.
