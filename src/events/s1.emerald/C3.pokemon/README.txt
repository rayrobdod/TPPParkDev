C3 

# Description
C3, like in the last game, will be bound and gagged in a hidden area before the player finds and frees him. While C3 is bound like this, the game will choose (when the player enters the park for the first time that day) where C3 is hidden. This spot remains consistant for a given day (it is saved with the game state). C3 could be in one of the following places:
	* Bound near a tree in one of the hidden groves.
	* Tied up in a bathroom stall in the Hall of Fame building.
	* Tied and shoved in a locker in a Locker Room (somewhere)
	*
	*
	
When the player interacts with C3 in this state, the game will ask "Would you like to untie him?". If the player does so, C3 will fall forward free of his bonds and then get up and thank you. He will then run off, vowing revenge on Apostropi. 

The game state then changes to indicate that next time the player enters the park, Apostropi will be the one tied up in various places around the park, and the player will be asked if he wishes to free her. This back and fourth never ceases.
